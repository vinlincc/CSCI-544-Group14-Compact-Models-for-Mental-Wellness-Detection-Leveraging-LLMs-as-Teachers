I sometime feel great and productive in the morning and when I'm about to leave home, I get this very down feeling forcing me to overthink about my appearance, my life, my education. Or in the other word, I feel good in the morning and feel worse in the afternoon. It happens like only 1 or 2 days a week, sometimes every 2 weeks, or sometimes none in a week. I have googled stuff about depression and bipolar (not sure what's the difference) but I'm not certain what I'm going through. I've been getting told to see a therapist on the internet but I don't feel like spending my money on that especially I have financial issues. Oh btw I'm male 20yo.

I feel inept and like a complete dumb ass but one kid gave me some respect and shook my hand so that felt good. It's mostly guys in there so I feel like there's less of the fakeness you would get from women. I think I would like the class if I were good at it and felt like I fit in better, but I'm completely self-conscious and I suck at some of the moves they teach us. I got owned by a couple teenagers the first week I went, made me feel like crap. I've never been much into sports. I deeply wish that someone would've taken time out of their day to help me understand sports or develop my athleticism but no one did. This kinda feels the way church used to. The longer I would skip out on church, the less likely I would be to go back and the more guilty I would feel. I do have other stuff to do.

And took my girlfriend of two years out to dinner on NYE, because that's our anniversary date. Silly me. Someone t-boned my rental car at 55-60 mph and completely destroyed both cars. Thank the fucking lord no one involved sustained any serious injuries, but me and my girlfriend are in pain and quite frankly, while I'm glad she's alive and ultimately okay, I wish I was dead. I'm on the hook for some serious fucking cash right now. I don't want to do this but I know I have to. For everyone else I've just been putting aside my fear and pain and anguish and self-doubt and I've been putting it into my work, finding extra hours and working for bonus etc. Hopefully I'll find a way out of this. Sorry for rambling. I don't want to tell this to anyone else. They just won't listen because both the accidents were my fault, so maybe I really am just a shit driver despite an otherwise squeaky-clean driving record of four years. I don't know what sign the lord, should he exist, is trying to send me. Maybe it's just to stay off of the road. Does the physical wellness dimension exists in the post?

I was previously on 80 mg of Prozac and it helped a little with regulating my mood, but then I think my anxiety got worse because I started having trouble staying asleep and my problems with concentration got even worse. My doctor started me on a 5-week cross-tapering plan to switch to Zoloft, and I am currently on day 2 of week 3 where I take 20 mg of Prozac and 50 mg of Zoloft. Today, however, I suddenly experienced diarrhea and really bad nausea for the first time. Has anyone had similar experiences and does anyone have any tips?

That's getting better now so I'm wanting to give the medication another go, but I'm really worried about the sexual part of the side effects. The few days I was on Citalopram, I lost all interest in sex. My penis felt pretty much numb and masturbating just to relieve myself was a stressful chore thanks to the delayed ejaculation.
